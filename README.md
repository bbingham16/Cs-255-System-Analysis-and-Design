# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The DriverPass project was a project that a company asked us to develop a program for. They noticed that 60 percent of students who take theri driving exam for the     first time, fail. They started DriverPAss coimpany in hopes to provide structured and informative online and in-person classes that will help inprove theri driving knowledge prior to taking the driving course. They wanted a website to implement a customer to be able to create and accouint, purchase pacakges, reserve a time for in-person driving instruction as well as the ability for admins to have full access over changes made to reservations and delete accounts.
  

What did you do particularly well?

  We made a lot of diagrams in this class. I learned a lot about how the software development lifecycle is envisioned byu creating these diagrams. It helped me better analayze the system as a whole, to see where imporvements could be made in the design. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would go back and change up my sequence diagram a bit. It was the one diagram that was easiest to understand but the design of it was tricky.  I think I would recreate that diagram and make it clearer to understand. 


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The user's needs are the most important. They are the ones constantly using the system. If they find that the system is hard to use, or experience frequent bugs or challenges, they are less inclined to use the system whcih would result in a loss of customer retentions for DriverPass.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I think it is very impoprtant to understand the system as a whole before designing the process. Asking the right questions to the client to make sure we are meeting all of their expectations and needs, and we are also capable of fulfilling their desires and wants in a program. For DriverPAss having the ability to change things in the furture as the company grew was imperative, as it is with most companies. So when thinking about how to design the software, we really have to be cognitive about the reusability of the code for future needs.
